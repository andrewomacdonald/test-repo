<center><h2>Greetings, plebs. You've come to the internet's number one source for
  everything Dagron Ballz. As the moderator of my own Dagron Ballz subreddit,
  I know literally everything there is to know about it. I also am quite handy
  with HTML as you can obviously tell, lol!
<p>It all started 2 weeks when my mom got me this REALLY SWEET silk screened shirt of
  Gorku, my favorite Dagronball. I really identify with his leet hairstyle and his
  rough and tumble 'tude. My second favorite Dagronball is easily Vegetable. You can read
  more about Vegetable <a href ="vegetable/vegetable.html">here.</a>"
</p>
<p>Here is a list of things better than Dagron Ballz (it's a very small list, lol):

    <h2><li>Ramen</li>
    <li>My katana collection</li></h2>
  </ul>

    me practicing the ways of the samurai:</h2></center>
